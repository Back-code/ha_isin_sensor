## Overview
The `Mini Stock Pocket` integration allows you to track stock prices and related information using ISIN (International Securities Identification Number) codes. This integration fetches real-time stock data and displays it as sensors in Home Assistant.

## Features
- **Add Stocks**: Add multiple stocks to a hub using their ISIN codes.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetch real-time stock prices and additional details such as currency, market, and price changes.
- **Portfolio Management**: Organize stocks into hubs for better management.
- **Edit Stocks**: Update stock quantities or add more stocks to an existing hub.
- **Delete Stocks**: Remove stocks from your portfolio.
- **Configuration via UI**: Supports configuration and management via the Home Assistant UI.

## Installation
1. Copy the `mini-stock-pocket` folder into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI by navigating to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and searching for "Mini Stock Pocket".

## Configuration
### Adding a Hub
1. Provide a unique name for your hub.
2. Add stocks by entering their ISIN codes, names, and quantities.

### Editing Stocks
You can edit or add more stocks to an existing hub via the integration's options:
- **Edit Stock Quantity**: Update the number of stocks for a specific ISIN.
- **Add More Stocks**: Add additional stocks to your portfolio.

### Deleting Stocks
Remove a stock from your portfolio by selecting it in the options menu.
